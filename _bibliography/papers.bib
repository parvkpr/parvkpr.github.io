  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Techniques based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)
are increasingly being used to design control policies for robotic
systems. RL fundamentally relies on state-based reward functions
to encode desired behavior of the robot and bad reward functions
are prone to exploitation by the learning agent, leading to behav-
ior that is undesirable in the best case and critically dangerous in
the worst. On the other hand, designing good reward functions
for complex tasks is a challenging problem. In this paper, we
propose expressing desired high-level robot behavior using a
formal specification language known as Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) as an alternative to reward/cost functions. We use STL
specifications in conjunction with model-based learning to design
model predictive controllers that try to optimize the satisfaction
of the STL specification over a finite time horizon. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on simulations of robotic
system such as a pick-and-place robotic arm, and adaptive cruise
control for autonomous vehicles},

  abstract ={Seamlessly integrating rules in Learning-from-Demonstrations (LfD) policies is a critical requirement to enable the real-world deployment of AI agents. Recently, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has been shown to be an effective language for encoding rules as spatio-temporal constraints. This work uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a means of integrating STL specification into a vanilla LfD policy to improve constraint satisfaction. We propose augmenting the MCTS heuristic with STL robustness values to bias the tree search towards branches with higher constraint satisfaction. While the domain-independent method can be applied to integrate STL rules online into any pre-trained LfD algorithm, we choose goal-conditioned Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning as the offline LfD policy. We apply the proposed method to the domain of planning trajectories for General Aviation aircraft around a non-towered airfield. Results using the simulator trained on real-world data showcase 60 percent improved performance over baseline LfD methods that do not use STL heuristics.},

  title={Challenges in Close-Proximity Safe and Seamless Operation of Manned and Unmanned Aircraft in Shared Airspace},
  abstract={We propose developing an integrated system to keep autonomous unmanned aircraft safely separated and behave as expected in conjunction with manned traffic. The main goal is to achieve safe manned-unmanned vehicle teaming to improve system performance, have each (robot/human) teammate learn from each other in various aircraft operations, and reduce the manning needs of manned aircraft. The proposed system anticipates and reacts to other aircraft using natural language instructions and can serve as a co-pilot or operate entirely autonomously. We point out the main technical challenges where improvements on current state-of-the-art are needed to enable Visual Flight Rules to fully autonomous aerial operations, bringing insights to these critical areas. Furthermore, we present an interactive demonstration in a prototypical scenario with one AI pilot and one human pilot sharing the same terminal airspace, interacting with each other using language, and landing safely on the same runway. We also show a demonstration of a vision-only aircraft detection system. },

      abstract={Robust and accurate localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an essential capability to achieve autonomous, long-range flights. Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a 20-meter range, with a minimum error below 1 meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.},

  title={Predicting food insecurity},
  author={Feffer, Michael and Kapoor, Parv and Dodt, Sebastian},
  abstract={In its longest drought in four decades, Somalia and other
countries in the Horn of Africa are currently facing an un-
precedented humanitarian crisis. 40 percent of the Somali popu-
lation (six million people) are estimated to be impacted by
severe acute food insecurity (WFP 2022c). The United Na-
tions Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UN OCHA) has released additional funds for humanitarian
aid in the region based on predictive analytics of its novel An-
ticipatory Action (AA) Team. Releasing “trigger warnings”
when food insecurity levels are predicted to reach critical lev-
els, AA employs data from partners that leverages manual
and qualitative methods for food insecurity classification and
prediction. The frequency of food insecurity prediction is 2-4
times per year making any subsequent modelling ill-equipped
to account for the dynamic nature of natural catastrophes and
conflicts. Additionally, the prediction accuracy has been sub-
ject to scrutiny. In this paper, we describe an AI-based ap-
proach that can automate this system and more accurately
forecast levels of hunger in real-time. We hope that our results
serve as a foundation for the use of AI in humanitarian relief
and lead to more targeted aid for vulnerable populations.},

  title={Investigating Robustness in Cyber-Physical
Systems: Specification-Centric Analysis in the face
of System Deviations},
  abstract= {

    The adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is on the rise in complex physical environments, encompassing domains such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. A critical attribute of CPS is robustness, denoting its capacity to operate safely despite potential disruptions and uncertainties in the operating environment. This paper proposes a novel specification-based robustness, which characterizes the effectiveness of a controller in meeting a specified system requirement, articulated through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) while accounting for possible deviations in the system. This paper also proposes the robustness falsification problem based on the definition, which involves identifying minor deviations capable of violating the specified requirement. We present an innovative two-layer simulation-based analysis framework designed to identify subtle robustness violations. To assess our methodology, we devise a series of benchmark problems wherein system parameters can be adjusted to emulate various forms of uncertainties and disturbances. Initial evaluations indicate that our falsification approach proficiently identifies robustness violations, providing valuable insights for comparing robustness between conventional and reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers },

  title={Safe Planning through Incremental Decomposition of Signal Temporal Logic},
  author={Kapoor, Parv and Meira-Goes, Romulo and Kang, Eunsuk},
  abstract={Trajectory planning is a critical process that enables au-
tonomous systems to safely navigate complex environments. Signal tem-
poral logic (STL) specifications are an effective way to encode complex,
temporally extended objectives for trajectory planning in cyber-physical
systems (CPS). However, the complexity of planning with STL using
existing techniques scales exponentially with the number of nested op-
erators and the time horizon of a given specification. Additionally, poor
performance is exacerbated at runtime due to limited computational bud-
gets and compounding modeling errors. Decomposing a complex speci-
fication into smaller subtasks and incrementally planning for them can
remedy these issues. In this work, we present a method for decomposing
STL specifications to improve planning efficiency and performance. The
key insight in our work is to encode all specifications as a set of basic
constraints called reachability and invariance constraints, and schedule
these constraints sequentially at runtime. Our experiment shows that the
proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory planning
techniques for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.},
