**Update: I am in Seattle over the summer interning at Scaled Foundations working on Robotics Foundation Models!**

Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I also work with the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) (CMU), the [AI for Systems Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/ai-for-systems/) (Microsoft Research New York City) and [Intelligent Connected Systems Group](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/itl/) (Toyota Infotech Labs).

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in leveraging software engineering methodologies to guarantee the safety and  reliability of AI systems. My ongoing research involves: 
1. Enhancing the robustness of reinforcement learning agents [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17066) [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04950)
2. Designing safe controllers for autonomous systems while adhering to formal high-level system specifications [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13737) [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06932)
3. Constraining Behavior of Robotics Foundation Models [[5]](/assets/pdf/RSS.pdf)
<!--3. Leveraging Alloy+LLMs for Semi Formal Programming (Requirements to Declarative Specifications to Code)-->

I am currently a part of [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/) and [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/#/). Prior to joining CMU, I worked with [Dr. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/)'s [CPS VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I have also researched with Dr. Thao Dang at the Université Grenoble Alpes and Dr. David Marshall at the Cardiff University.
