Hi, I am a second-year graduate student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Software Engineering. My research interests span the fields of verification of Cyber-Physical Systems behavior and safe planning and control methods for robotic systems.â€‹ I am advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I am part of [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/) and [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/#/). I also work with [Dr. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html)'s [SafeAI lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). 

Prior to joining CMU, I worked with [Dr. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/)'s [CPS VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).


Here is my [Resume](/assets/pdf/Parv Kapoor.pdf). Feel free to drop me an email to discuss collaboration opportunities!

##### <span style="color:Maroon;font-family:Papyrus; font-style:italic"> [Safe and Seamless Operation of Manned and Unmanned Aircraft in Shared Airspace](/blog/2022/proj1/) </span>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/safety_9.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"%}
    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify"> We defined a new angular rate based control barrier function for safe collision avoidance of autonomous aircrafts. We evaluate our method on a realistic flight simulator with a uman pilot acting as an adversary.

##### <span style="color:Maroon;font-family:Papyrus; font-style:italic"> [Richer feedback guided planning for Temporal Logic specified objectives](/blog/2022/proj3/) </span>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/185.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"%}
    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify"> We define a correction/introspective semantics over bounded STL
patterns for easier plan generation. We also propose a novel MCTS methods inspired by our newer heuristics. 
</div>

##### <span style="color:Maroon;font-family:Papyrus; font-style:italic"> [Model based Reinforcement Learning from STL specifications](/blog/2020/proj5/) </span>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/fetchreach.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"%}
    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify">  We use STL
specifications in conjunction with model-based learning to design
model predictive controllers that try to optimize the satisfaction
of the STL specification over a finite time horizon.
</div>

##### <span style="color:Maroon;font-family:Papyrus; font-style:italic"> [Predicting food insecurity](/blog/2022/proj4/) </span>
<br>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/IPC.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"%}
    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify">  In this paper, we have presented a new
method to derive predictions for food insecurity. If imple-
mented by international humanitarian aid organizations, it
can make humanitarian assistance more rapid, efficient, and
more equitably distributed
