Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I also work with the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/).

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, particularly in leveraging software engineering methodologies to guarantee the safety and  reliability of AI systems. My ongoing research involves: 
1. Enhancing the robustness of reinforcement learning agents
2. Designing safe controllers for autonomous systems while adhering to formal high-level system specifications
3. Developing real-time monitoring and alignment strategies for Large Language Models (LLM) agents. 

I am currently a part of [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/) and [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/#/). Prior to joining CMU, I worked with [Dr. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/)'s [CPS VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).
