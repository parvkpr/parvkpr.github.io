Hi! I am a second-year graduate student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Software Engineering. I am broadly interested in assuring safety in robots and autonomy. My current research focuses on robustness of reinforcement learning agents, safe planning and control for aerial robots and runtime monitoring for cyber-physical systems. I am advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I am part of [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/) and [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/#/). I also work with [Dr. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html)'s [SafeAI lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). 

Prior to joining CMU, I worked with [Dr. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/)'s [CPS VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).


Here is my [Resume](/assets/pdf/Parv Kapoor.pdf). Feel free to drop me an email to discuss collaboration opportunities!

    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify"> In this work, We devise new methods of trust inference in human robot collaboration. Additionally, We are focused on identifying the relationship between user customizations and perceived user trust. We are currently running the pilot user study through assistive gym simulator. We hope to use these factors to improve assistive robot design and devise new trust restoration techniques.

    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify"> We defined a new angular rate based control barrier function for safe collision avoidance of autonomous aircrafts. We evaluate our method on a realistic flight simulator with a human pilot acting as an adversary.

##### <span style="color:Maroon;font-family:Georgia;"> [Follow The Rules: Online Signal Temporal Logic Tree Search for Guided Imitation Learning in Stochastic Domains](/blog/2022/proj2/) </span>
<span style="color:#29465B;font-family:serif;"> Jasmine Aloor, Jay Patrikar,</span> <span style="color:#29465B;font-family:serif;font-weight:bold;">Parv Kapoor</span><span style="color:#29465B;font-family:serif;">, Sebastian Scherer, Jean Oh </span>

    </div>

<div class="col-sm" style="text-align: justify"> This work uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a means of integrating STL specification into a vanilla LfD policy to improve constraint satisfaction. We propose augmenting the MCTS
heuristic with STL robustness values to bias the tree search towards branches with higher constraint satisfaction.
