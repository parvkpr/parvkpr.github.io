Hi, I am a first-year graduate student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Software Engineering. My research interests span the fields of verification of Cyber-Physical Systems behavior and safe planning and control methods for robotic systems.â€‹ I am advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I am part of [AirLab](http://theairlab.org/) and [SoDA](https://cmu-soda.github.io/#/). I also work with [Dr. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html)'s [SafeAI lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io/). Prior to joining CMU, I worked with [Dr. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh](https://jdeshmukh.github.io/)'s [CPS VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/).
