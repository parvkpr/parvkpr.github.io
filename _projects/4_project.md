This work was accepted to NASA formal Methods 2024. Our goal was to show decomposing STL specifications can combine the correctness of specification guided synthesis to efficient convex optimization for trajectory synthesis. [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10554) is a link to the paper for more information.
